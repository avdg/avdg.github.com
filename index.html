    <h1>Things I can</h1>
</div>

<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Programming in php and javascript. I've done some coding in other programming languages though like qbasic, c, c++, python and java.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Big organized code shouldn't be a problem for me, as long as it's readable and structured (like mvc, autoloading syntax, etc...)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Keeping files organized with git on the commandline, handy to keep track of what happened to the code</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">I know how to deal with package managers like npm, composer and apt-get</li>
<li class="list-group-item">I have an idea how build scripts work like make, gulp and grunt</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">I do know that testing code is important (PHPUnit, mocha)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Lookup documentation and stuff on the internet. Important to use API, web services, frameworks and libraries</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Contributed to open source and patch up code used by many other developers, see the contribution section above</li>
<li class="list-group-item">I keep on learning new things and attempt to catch up with the latest technology.</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">Did you notice that this page is crafted in html and bootstrap :-)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">I accept mixed rubics cubes and may return them in a (nearly) solved position.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-center bubble">Don't feel afraid to ask question, which may be done in dutch and english. Maybe I can help you with something.</p>

<div class="page-header">
    <h1>Things that interest me</h1>
</div>

<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item">Things like angular, react and vue.js make the development of interactive apps way easier.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Cordova allows web pages to pop up as native apps on other platforms.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Nativescript seems promising allowing javascript to access native api on platforms, need to find out how far this goes.</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Any development on html5 js api that gains more access to hardware features is nice to have (as long as safety isn't an issue).</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Well designed websocket api would allow interactive apps where necessary</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Of course, some stuff has to be stored serverside, so it's always nice to have a nice stack of server software available like a server, db, etc...</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">Development tools and well designed structures, especially unit testing tools. Not because of correctness (which is obviously important), but more to keep productivity higher than doing stuff without it when things get more complex. What would life be without testing :=/</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Rust as programming language, which may potentially take over c and c++ at some point if progress in the language continues as it is "memory safe by default" (but not necessarily replace it as rewriting code is a lot of work)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">The opengl model in general, nice to be able to create 3d apps.</li>
</ul>
