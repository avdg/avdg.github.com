    <h1>Things that interest me</h1>
</div>

<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item">Things like angular, react and vue.js make the development of interactive apps way easier.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Assemblyscript seems promising allowing near machine code on platforms.</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Any development on html5 js api that gains more access to hardware features is nice to have (as long as safety isn't an issue).</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Well designed websocket api would allow interactive apps where necessary</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Of course, some stuff has to be stored serverside, so it's always nice to have a nice stack of server software available like a server, db, etc...</li>
<li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">Development tools and well designed structures, especially unit testing tools. Not because of correctness (which is obviously important), but more to keep productivity higher than doing stuff without it when things get more complex. What would life be without testing :=/</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Rust as programming language, which may potentially take over c and c++ at some point if progress in the language continues as it is "memory safe by default" (but not necessarily replace it as rewriting code is a lot of work)</li>
<li class="list-group-item">The opengl model in general, nice to be able to create 3d apps.</li>
</ul>
